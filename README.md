# Water-Level-Monitoring-System-IOT-Android

A simple Android app that gives you the real time information about current water levels in a tank and alarms you if the water levels are below or above the given thresholds.
It connects to the wifi network of an arduino configured using this: [Water-Level-Monitoring-System-IOT-Arduino](https://github.com/Talha-Siddiqui3/Water-Level-Monitoring-System-IOT-Arduino). 
It parses the real time water level information and displays it using an animation.
